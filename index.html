        <p>Hey everyone I am super excited to be taking this class with you all this semester. I am currently working toward an Applied Technology degree. I find web design, app and game creation, and coding fascinating. I hope to learn as much as possible to help me choose a career that will suit me and that I can have fun in while making a living.</p>
        <p>I have always had a great deal of interest in technology and I think that I will really enjoy a career where I can work on it and still make money. I'm not as good with people as with machines unfortunately and it just seems easier to deal with codes and programs that will always react exactly the way that they should, and if they dont then its something that can be fixed and understood.</p>
        <p>I think that learning about web design specifically will help me in many ways, in either working with websites as a part of a future career or in setting up my own website to offer services or products. Online advertising, information gathering and use is definately the way of the future (and the current!). As for my personal life, I have been a member of the church for my entire life, although I have not been as active as I probably should be all the time. My favorite scripture is 1st Nephi 4:13.</p>
